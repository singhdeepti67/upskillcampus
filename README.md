ABOUT PASSWORD MANAGER
A password manager is a software tool that securely stores and manages a user's various passwords and login credentials. It helps users create strong, unique passwords, stores them in an encrypted format, and facilitates easy access to these passwords when needed. Password managers enhance security by reducing the reliance on weak or repeated passwords, and they often include features like password generation, autofill, and cross-device synchronization for seamless use across platforms.
